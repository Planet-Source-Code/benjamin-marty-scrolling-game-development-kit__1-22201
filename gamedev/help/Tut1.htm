        Creating Graphics</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Verdana">The tileset editor within GameDev
        opens a full screen display in order to ensure the
        desired color depth for the images. This may make it
        difficult to follow this tutorial on-screen, so before
        beginning you may wish to print this page out for
        reference as you proceed with this first step of the
        tutorial. However, if that's not an option, GameDev does
        allow you to Alt-Tab between the full-screen display and
        the desktop.</font></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Verdana">From the main project view in GameDev,
all areas of the program can be accessed via the View menu. We
want to start out editing Tilesets. Tilesets store the graphics
for all the tiles and sprites. Select &quot;Tilesets&quot; from
the view menu and the Edit Tilesets dialog will appear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">From the Edit Tilesets dialog you can
create new Tilesets, create Tilesets based on existing images,
import pieces of other images into a Tileset and manage tilesets
in other ways. Right now we want to create a new Tileset, but
first we need to specify some parameters for the tileset.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Leave the default values of 32 for
        tile width and tile height.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Change the number of Tile Rows to 4
        instead of 10 (click the arrows or enter a the number),
        but leave Tile Columns at 10.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Each tileset needs a distinct name.
        Lets name this tileset Tutorial. Type the word Tutorial
        into the Name field.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">If you want to skip this step and use
graphics already prepared for the tutorial, you can click the
&quot;Load Image&quot; button and load Tutorial.bmp which
contains the graphics we will be creating in this step.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The next step is to click the Create
button. Before you do this, note the selection for screen depth
at the bottom of the window. This is not a setting saved with the
tileset, but is an option for how to open the full-screen display
to begin the tile editor. It can, however, affect the format of
the tileset. For this tutorial, let's leave the selection at
16-bit color. Some video cards do not support 24-bit color or
32-bit color. Editing a tileset in 16-bit color mode will reduce
the format of the graphics to 16-bit color. Be careful if you
load a 24-bit color image into a 16-bit color editor, some color
information can be permanently lost.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">After clicking the Create button the full
screen tile editor is presented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><img src="Images/TileEdit.GIF"
width="640" height="480"></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The first thing we should do is click the
button that reads &quot;Make 16-bit&quot;. This forces all colors
in the color palette to map exactly to a 16-bit color. If this is
not done, a flood fill may fill an area with a dithered color.
The change is imperceptible (at least to me) but if you start
filling and re-fillling areas with inexact colors, you will see
the problem.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/SteelCtr.GIF" align="left" hspace="6"
width="32" height="32"><font face="Verdana">Lets start with some
very basic graphics that we can use to draw tiles on the map, and
later on, to include in our sprite definitions. We'll start with
a tile representing a solid chunk of steel. The fifth color from
the left on the bottom row of the palette looks like a good steel
grey. Left click on this color, then click the &quot;Solid
rectangle&quot; button. Drag the mouse from coordinate 0,0 to
31,31 - that should result in a grey rectangle accross the whole
grid. (Mouse coordinates can be seen directly below the grid on
the left side.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">When drawing graphics onto the tile
editor, the mouse can be clicked on either the grid with the
magnified view of the tile, or on the tile graphic itself, to the
right of the grid at the top. These areas represent the tile in
memory that has not been stored into the tileset... consider it a
working area for the tile graphic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now let's add some shinyness/irregularity
to the &quot;steel surface&quot;. The eighth color from the end
of the palette looks like a good steel blue. Select this and then
click the line button. Draw some parallel diagonal lines on the
gray tile. Try some white lines too (the last color). Draw the
lines at a 45 degree angle to the edge for reasons we'll see
later.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">It looks a little pixeled, let's try to
fix that. Click the &quot;Smooth&quot; button and drag a
rectangle over the entire grid (just as was done for the grey
rectangle). Viola, automatic pixel blurring (almost as good as
anti-aliasing).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Good enough, let's store this tile in the
Tileset. When the tile editor first comes up, the very first tile
in the Tileset is selected by default. We don't want to store the
tile in the first &quot;slot&quot; because this is the tile used
as the background when drawing the map (tile zero). Since we're
going to stick with a black background right now, select the next
tile. To do this, click the right arrow (&quot;&gt;&quot;) button
below the grid or click on the next tile in the tileset window
near the bottom right. Store the tile into that slot by clicking
the &quot;Store&quot; button below the grid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">If you want to draw a second similar tile
(this might be good so that not all solid metal looks exactly the
same) click the clear button and repeat the process starting with
the gray rectangle. Store the resulting tile into another empty
slot in the tileset.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/MetalNum.jpg" align="right" hspace="6"
width="137" height="147"><font face="Verdana">The tile(s) you
have just drawn will be the center of a number of tiles that we
will use on the map to construct larger structures. Now we need
to define some edge pieces that can be put around this tile to
make it blend nicely with the background. Let's start with a
block for the top edge and we'll move on from there.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">To make the edge pieces we will fade the
steel gray to a darker shadowed color, and at the very edge have
a solid bright surface. Let's create our own shadowed color in
the palette. Pick a color that we haven't used (with a left mouse
click on the palette). Now use the R++, R+, R-, R--, G++, G-
(etc.) buttons to adjust the components of that color. Get
something around R=20, G=20, B=40.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/SteelTop.gif" align="left" hspace="6"
width="32" height="32"><font face="Verdana">To make a smooth
gradient from the shadowed grey to steel grey, click the vertical
gradient button. It's possible to make gradients in the palette
itself, but we don't need to because we're drawing a simple
vertical gradient rectangle. Now select the colors for the
gradient: left-click on the shadowed grey and right-click on the
steel grey. Drag a rectangle (left mouse button) on the grid that
covers the whole tile. This should result in a smooth gradient
with the shadowed color at the top and the lighter steel grey at
the bottom.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Draw some of the same diagonal lines that
we drew for the center block, but confine them mainly to the
lower half of this tile. Also, perform the same smooth operation
afterwards. (Don't forget to select the proper tools before
drawing on the grid.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now we need to add the solid edge on top.
A shorter gradient to white should do the trick. Left click on
white and right click on the shadowed color. Click the vertical
gradient button and draw a 4-pixel-high rectangle accross the top
of the tile. This tile is done! Store it to a blank slot in the
tileset and we'll move on.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">When drawing gradient rectangles, the
color selected with the mouse button always goes on the corner
where the drag was started. If you use the right mouse button to
drag, the color selected with the right mouse button goes at that
corner.</font></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="6">
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Verdana">This edge tile can be easily
        manipulated to quickly make the tiles for all the edges.
        In the process you'll learn how to use the rotate and
        flip commands.</font><p><font face="Verdana">Click the
        Copy button. The flip and rotate commands only operate on
        the copied clip of graphics, not directly on the tile.
        Select the whole tile (drag accross the whole grid). Now
        the whole tile has been copied into the tile editors
        &quot;clipboard&quot; (which is not the system
        clipboard).</font></p>
        </td>
        <td valign="top"><img src="Images/ArLeft.gif" width="51"

        height="50"></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Verdana">To make the tile for the right edge,
click the &quot;Right 15&quot; button until the rotation is at
-90 degrees. The tile is facing the right direction now, but the
diagonal lines are going the wrong direction. Now since the lines
were drawn at a 45 degree angle there's a simple solution to
this. Click the X Flip button to flip the copied clip
horizontally. Now when we paste the clip the diagonal lines will
be going in the right direction. Click the &quot;Paste+&quot;
button. This is the tool used to paste the clip when it is
rotated (Paste will paste exactly what you see under
&quot;Clip&quot;).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">As you move the mouse pointer over the
grid you will see the clip draw in it's rotated orientation,
centered around the mouse pointer. Move the pointer until the
rotated clip covers all the pixels on the grid, then click the
left mouse button. You now have a tile for the right edge. Store
this tile into a blank slot in the tileset.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now continue to rotate and flip the tile
in various ways until you have a tile for all the flat edges
(left, right, top, bottom). Store each of these into the tileset.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The corner tiles will take a bit more
effort. To get us started, load the tile for the top edge. We're
going to need one column of pixels that contains the exact
gradient used in the edge tiles. If your diagonal lines (or their
smoothed pixels) have affected the edges of this tile, avoid
these edges in the following steps (You may need to re-create the
gradient without diagonal lines if both edges of your gradient
were affected by the diagonal lines).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Copy one column of pixels by clicking the
copy button and dragging from the top of the tile to the bottom
of the tile without enclosing more that one column width of
pixels. Be sure to do this on a column of pixels that has not
been affected by the diagonal lines. This column of pixels will
be used as a pattern to reproduce the gradient diagonally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now click the clear button to clear out
the grid to prepare for a new tile. Paste the column of pixels
along the left side of the of the new tile so it extends from the
top to the bottom of the leftmost column of pixels in the tile.
Now use the rotate buttons to set the rotation to -90 degrees
(right 90 degrees). Click on Paste+ and paste the one row of
pixels along the bottom of the tile. There should be one pixel
where the two paste operations intersect at the bottom left
corner and the color of that pixel should be the same in both.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now that the edges are set up to match
neighboring tiles, we'll fill in the rest. This tile will be a
sloped tile to fill in the top right corner of a block of steel
tiles. The slope will extent from the top left corner to the
bottom right, filled in on the bottom left half of the tile. The
easiest way to do this is to click the &quot;Make R. Button
Pick&quot; button and then click the line button to start drawing
lines. Note that when you now right-click on the grid, the color
at that pixel will be assigned to the currently selected color in
the palette (primary selection). So be sure the currently
selected color is not an important color. If you do lose an
important color, you can click the Reset button to re-initialize
the color palette. Remember to click &quot;Make 16-bit&quot;
again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Right-click the top-leftmost pixel of the
tile (white) then left click and drag down to the
bottom-rightmost pixel. Right-click on the pixel to the left
(30,31) then click and drag to 0,1. Right-click on 0,2 then click
and drag to 29,31. Continue this process until the lower left
half of the tile is completely filled in. Store the new tile into
a blank slot in the tileset.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/SteelAll.GIF" align="left" hspace="6"
width="96" height="96"><font face="Verdana">Before adding any
diagonal lines to this image, we should rotate/flip it in all
directions to get the 4 corner pieces we will need (If you add
the diagonal lines too soon, the tile will only be usable for two
corners instead of four, if you want all the diagonal lines to be
parallel). So flip and rotate as necessary and store all 4 corner
pieces into the tileset. After this is done you may wish to go
add diagonal lines to them. Be careful not to smooth any area
beyond the white edge or the white will smear into the black.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Only 6 more tiles are necessary for a
complete set of tiles that can be used to make any shape.
Currently we only have the tiles necessary for a convex shape. To
allow concave shapes we need inner corners. Copy the same column
of pixels used in the previous section on making the sloped
tiles. However, this time the top pixel (white) should be
excluded from the copy, resulting in a 31-pixel column instead of
a 32-pixel column. This is done because in a series of sloped
tiles, the neighboring exterior tiles will contain the white
pixels while this new tile resides entirely on the interior.
Paste the copied graphic at the top of the leftmost column of a
blank tile, as before, but this time, rotate it the other
direction and paste the second image (horizontal row of pixels)
along the top so the 2 lightest-grey pixels overlap.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The bottom-most pixel and right-most
pixels should be copied from the neighboring pixel. Since there
were only 31 pixels in the copied graphic, the bottom and right
would be black, but we want it to be grey. This can be
accomplished by pasting each version of the graphic twice: for
instance, paste the graphic at 0,1 before pasting at 0,0.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/SteelInn.GIF" align="left" hspace="6"
width="65" height="64"><font face="Verdana">Now connect the edges
with diagonal lines like before. Right-click on the
bottom-leftmost pixel, then click and drag to the top-rightmost
pixel. Then right-click on 30,0 and click and drag to 0,30. Right
click on 0,29, then click and drag to 29,0. Repeat until the
upper left half of the tile is completely filled. Store the tile
when complete and <strong>KEEP </strong>this copy of the tile as
is because we will need it for the last 2 tiles. Now fill the
lower right half of the tile with the steel gray color. This is
actually the tile that we will use on the map. Rotate it 4
directions and store it, add diagonal lines and smooth if you
wish.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The two remaining tiles apply when two
2-by-2 blocks of tiles overlap at their corners. Load the tile
that was stored to &quot;<strong>KEEP</strong>&quot; in the
previous step. It should be noted here that &quot;Paste+&quot;
treats a color as the transparent color if it appears in all 4
corners of the copies clip.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/SteelAng.GIF" align="left" hspace="6"
width="33" height="64"><font face="Verdana">This being said, we
want to have a transparent color - we'll want to make all 4
corners black. Left-click an unused color in the palette and
(assuming R. Button Pick is turned on) right-click the lightest
grey pixel at the top left corner (this pixel represents the area
closest to the exterior edge of the tile). We need to remember
that color for later. Now put a black pixel in each corner of the
tile currently loaded into the grid. Then copy the entire tile
into the &quot;clipboard&quot; with the copy button (and then
dragging over the whole grid). Now set the rotation to 180
degrees and click on Paste+. You should see when you move the
mouse over the grid that the triangle fits nicely into the empty
half of the tile without disturbing the half of the tile already
there. Match it up so the whole tile is full (except the corners)
and click to paste. Select the previously stored color from the
palette, select the &quot;Pixel&quot; button and put the light
grey pixels back on the exterior corners (there are now two of
them). Then select the steel grey color from the color palette
and click the two steel grey pixels into place in the other two
corners.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Store the tile into the tileset, copy it
into the clipboard, flip it, paste it and store this one too, and
you're done! These are all the tiles necessary to create a
complete TileMatch definition.</font></p>

<hr>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Sprite Graphics</font></h4>

<p><font face="Verdana">We have the tiles we need for the the
basic framework of the map, but it won't be very interesting
without something else to put on the map. The most fun type of
sprite to make is one that turns is all directions (well, 36
directions feels like all directions anyway). For this we need 36
consecutive blank tiles. There's not enough room in the tileset
to store these tiles right now. So this is a good time to
demonstrate the &quot;Update&quot; command on the tileset.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Close the tileset editor with the close
button. This would also be a good time to save what you've done
so far. After closing the full screen editor, click the tileset
name in the list (the &quot;[L]&quot; means it's currently loaded
into memory). Click the Save button and specify a path and
filename for the BMP file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now click the tileset name (if it's not
already selected) and increase the number of rows from 4 to 8.
Then click the Update button. The screen will flip into full
screen mode momentarily while the graphics are manipulated on a
full screen display. If you select the tileset and click the Edit
button to return to the editor now, you will see there are 4 new
rows of blank tiles. This is enough to create a 36-state rotating
sprite.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/ShipRite.GIF" align="left" hspace="6"
width="32" height="32"><font face="Verdana">Let's create a simple
spaceship type graphic. It should be pointing to the right
because when we define the sprite using the graphic, the
automatic sprite frame assignment starts at zero degrees (which
corresponds to something pointing to the right).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">My ship was composed entirely of
ellipses. The entire ship should be constrained to a few pixels
from the edge, even more near the corners. The reason for this
has to do with rotation. When the image is rotated 45 degrees,
the rotated image must also fit inside the same square. So if you
want to make a ship shaped exactly like mine, here are my
parameters</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Dark red ellipse from 6,5 to 19,26
        (the body of the ship)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Light red ellipse from 15,9 to 28,22
        (the head of the ship)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Grey ellipse from 4,6 to 8,10 (left
        thruster)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Grey ellipse from 4,21 to 8,25
        (right thruster)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">Store this image of the ship into the
tileset in a blank slot. Choose a slot on a row that doesn't have
any other images. The automatic rotation process will store
rotated image in the 35 cells following the current cell,
overwriting anything that may already be contained in them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Click the &quot;Turn AA On&quot; to turn
Anti-Aliasing on. If the button reads &quot;Turn AA Off&quot;
then Anti-Aliasing is already turned on. Then click the
&quot;Make 360°/10°&quot; button. Watch as the original tile is
rotated to 35 other consecutive orientations and stored into the
tileset.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Images/Ship120.GIF" align="left" hspace="6"
width="32" height="32"><font face="Verdana">Notice that the
images that didn't fall exactly at a multiple of 90 degrees are a
bit blurred by the anti-aliasing and don't quite match the images
that are at exactly 90-degree increments. To make all the images
look more uniform let's smooth the images that still have sharp
edges. For each ship image in the tileset that has the sharp
edges (there should be 4) do the following:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Select it in the tileset</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Click the Get button</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Click the Smooth button to select
        the smoothing tool</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Drag a rectangle over the entire
        tile editing grid</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Click the Store button.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">Those are all the graphics we need for
our sprite. Just a little more left before the tileset's done.</font></p>

<hr>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Inventory Graphics</font></h4>

<p><font face="Verdana">Generally a single graphic can be used
both to represent an item on the map as well as in the inventory.
We're going to create two simple tiles to represent items the
player can pick up and own.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/Scraper.gif" align="left" hspace="6"
width="32" height="32"><font face="Verdana">Your artwork may be
better than mine here so feel free to improvise. The first item I
wanted to represent was a &quot;scraper&quot;. This is something
that can be used to &quot;scrape&quot; away walls. I used the
pencil tool to draw a sharpened-looking &quot;tool&quot; onto a
representation of the front of the ship. Then I used the smooth
tool to pretend it didn't look so bad. You may wish to draw
something more drill-like.</font></p>

<p><img src="Images/Staff.GIF" align="left" hspace="6" width="32"
height="32"><font face="Verdana">The second item is some sort of
staff. I drew the base and the ball separately, smoothed them,
then joined them together by transparently pasting the base over
the ball using Paste+. Some near-black pixels had to be removed
after smoothing (before copying) for this to look good. Remember
all four corners of a copied graphic must be <strong>exactly</strong>
the same color in order for Paste+ to pick a transparent color.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">These two tiles should be stored into two
blank slots in the tileset. There should be plenty remaining.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">These are all the graphics we need for
our basic tutorial. Click the close button, select the tileset in
the list of tilesets in the &quot;Edit Tilesets&quot; window and
click the &quot;Save Image&quot; button. Specify the name of the
same bitmap used earlier and save our completed Tutorial tileset.</font></p>
