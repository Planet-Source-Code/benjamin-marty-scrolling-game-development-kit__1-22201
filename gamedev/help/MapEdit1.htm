<h2>Edit Maps Dialog</h2>

<p>This is probably the most involved dialog in GameDev. For this
reason, the documentation is split into 5 parts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>This page describes the overall dialog in general terms,
        and provides information on editing attributes of the map
        itself in the top half of the dialog.</li>
    <li>Help on the Layers tab is available in <a
        href="MapEdit2.htm">Editing Map Layers</a>.</li>
    <li>Help on the full screen map editor (accessible from the
        Edit button in the Layers tab) is available in <a
        href="MapEdit3.htm">The Full Screen Map Editor</a>.</li>
    <li>Help on the Player Interaction tab is available in <a
        href="MapEdit4.htm">Player Map Interactions</a>.</li>
    <li>Help on the Special Functions tab is available in <a
        href="MapEdit5.htm">Special Functions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the top of the dialog you will see the list of all the maps
in the current project. Clicking on one of these loads the
remainder of the dialog with information related to this map. If
the map has been saved to a file, this filename will appear in
the &quot;Path&quot; field. A map must be selected in the top
half of this dialog to use most of the bottom half.</p>

<p>A map is somewhat separated from the individual layers that
make up its main contents. This is because, while a map can have
an overall size (dictating how far the player on the map can
travel), the individual layers may scroll at different rates.
Therefore the size of the map itself and the size of the
individual layers must have some inherent separation. To begin
understanding how to use the Edt Maps dialog let's step through a
short description of each of the fields associated directly with
a map:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Map Name determines how the map is referenced within the
        project. This is separate from the filename. If you
        decide to change the filename or path of the map (by
        clicking Save Map), the map name can remain the same and
        still be accessed by the rest of project without
        requiring changes anywhere else. Map names must be unique
        within the space of all the map names.</li>
    <li>Map Display: The Left, Top, Width and Height fields of
        the map display indicate where on the screen the map is
        drawn. This is useful if you want to reserve one portion
        of the display just for the map, and another portion
        purely for display of the inventory. Left should be in
        the range 0 to 639 and Top should be in the range 0 to
        479. The sum of Left and Width should be no greater than
        640 and the sum of Top and Height should be no greater
        than 480. For the map to occupy the entire display, 0, 0,
        640 and 480 are the values for Left, Top, Width and
        Height respectively.</li>
    <li>The size of the map is determined in pixels in the Width
        and Height fields. Since (as mentioned above) the map can
        consist of multiple layers that may scroll at different
        rates and may use different sized tiles, it's necessary
        for the overall map size to be determined in pixels. The
        size of the map in pixels is used to determine the size
        of the layers added to the map based on the layer's
        scroll rate and tile size. This allows the size of the
        map to be changed (using the Update button) so that all
        the layers within the map can be automatically resized.</li>
    <li>The Path is a read-only field indicating where the map
        file is saved if it has been saved. To change this, use
        the &quot;Save Map&quot; button and specify a new path
        name.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Name, Path and &quot;Map Display&quot; parameters are
saved in the GDP project file while the width and height (and
everything else related to a map) are stored in the MAP file
indicated by the Path parameter. The distinction here is that the
Width and Height are very closely tied to the remainder of the
map (the size of the layers), but the display parameters, name
and path are attributes that the project needs to know in order
to reference, load and display the map.</p>

<p>Entering the parameters described in the top half of the
dialog and clicking the &quot;New Map&quot; button creates the
new map object and adds it to the list. This map, however,
consists of very little data -- just the parameters that were
entered. The main content of a map is stored in its layers.</p>
