<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>This page lists issues that may frequently arise while using
GameDev and describes the cause and/or solution to them.</p>

<h3>HELP! My project is corrupted!</h3>

<p>While I'm not currently aware of any serious problems in
GameDev version 1.2 that would corrupt a project, it may not be
perfect. If you run across a serious problem, please report it.
See the <a href="TechSupt.htm">Technical Support</a> page for
more information. Version 1.1 did have a problem with the
re-ordering of layers. Since special functions were associated to
the map by layer index, and I had forgotten to re-index functions
when the layers were moved, special functions would have serious
problems when you moved the player's layer to a different
position in the sequence. This problem has been fixed in version
1.2, however. Special functions were the only objects connected
to the map with a layer index. Furthermore, this problem is one
that can be fixed by the &quot;XML&quot; solution described
below.</p>

<p>Don't worry yet, there are a few ways to recover data from a
project. One way to attempt recovering the data yourself is to
export it as an XML file. Load the XML file into Notepad and see
if you can locate the problem and fix it. Then re-import the
project into GameDev. If you think the error is at a project
level (as opposed to the map level) you can try editing the GDP
file in Notepad, but keep a backup. Another option, if you own
Visual Basic 6.0, is to download the GameDev source code and run
GameDev in a debug environment and attempt to fix your project in
the debugger. Finally, I'm willing to look into these sort of
problems myself seeing as how I haven't had a lot of requests for
help (as of this writing). Feel free to contact me and I'll see
what I can do.</p>

<p>The best measure to take against a corrupted project, though,
is to keep backups. Even if GameDev works perfectly, it's all too
easy to bring up a tileset in 16-bit color and then save it
(thereby potentially losing valuable color information). Or if
you ignore the warnings and options and play around with the
player sprite in the map editor, you could make permanent
unwanted changes to the map. These kind of things can't be undone
except by keeping good backups.</p>

<h3>I can't see all my layers (some are missing) in the map
editor</h3>

<p>Make sure that there are no layers in front of your layer that
are opaque. A layer on top of another layer (in the foreground)
will cover up layers below it when:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The &quot;Transparent layer&quot; checkbox is not checked
        for the layer</li>
    <li>The layer consists of tiles that aren't tile number 0,
        and tiles that are completely opaque. The layer in only
        transparent on tile number 0 and in areas of other tiles
        that use the same color as the top left pixel of their
        respective tileset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, make sure there's something to see. Draw some tiles on
the layer. You can't see anything until it has some content. Make
sure to draw tiles other than tile number 0 which is the
transparent tile for transparent layers and is not drawn (even if
it contains graphics).</p>

<h3>I just added a new layer, but it's full of tiles</h3>

<p>For the opaque (background) layer, tile number 0 fills the map
to form the background of the display.</p>

<h3>I added a sprite to the project, but I can't select it as the
player</h3>

<p>The player sprite needs to have the &quot;Initial
Instance&quot; checkbox checked. The game can't start without an
instance of the player on the map. Only &quot;Initial
Instance&quot; sprites are listed as options for the player
sprite.</p>

<h3>My sprite is not reacting to solid areas as expected</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Go to the Sprites and Paths dialog.</li>
    <li>Click on the sprite definition for your sprite and load
        it.</li>
    <li>Go to the Motion tab.</li>
    <li>Note the current selection for &quot;Solid tiles&quot;.</li>
    <li>Note the Layer name under the &quot;Paths&quot; list --
        the layer on which this sprite gets created.</li>
    <li>Go to the Edit Maps dialog.</li>
    <li>Click on the layer noted above.</li>
    <li>Note the tileset selected for this layer.</li>
    <li>Go to the &quot;Tile Categories&quot; dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the tileset noted above.</li>
    <li>In the &quot;Solidity Definition Name&quot; list, you
        should see the solidity definition that you had selected
        on the Motion tab in the Sprites and Paths dialog. If
        not, then you have made an invalid selection for
        &quot;Solid tiles&quot; on the Motion tab, or have
        created an instance of this sprite on a layer where it is
        not prepared to interact properly with the layer.</li>
    <li>If it is there, load it and verify the correctness of the
        categories that make up the solidity definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>When creating a sprite template, the solidity definitions are
listed for the currently selected path's layer's tileset.
However, there is nothing preventing you from creating another
sprite based on the same template and putting that sprite on a
different layer using a different tileset. It's unlikely that the
same solidity definition will work will on tilesets other than
that for which it was designed.</p>

<p>Also, even with a proper solidity definition, only the corners
of a sprite are checked for interaction with solid map. It's
possible for pointy areas of the map to get between the corners
of the sprite.</p>

<h3>I defined a TileMatch, but it doesn't show up in the map
editor as a selection</h3>

<p>Only TileMatches that apply to the tileset of the layer
currently being edited are listed.</p>

<h3>I'm using a TileMatch eraser, but the results don't look good</h3>

<p>The eraser cannot prevent you from making areas of the map
that don't match up. That's because, using the eraser, it is
possible to delete just one tile from a 2x2 block of well-matched
tiles. A TileMatch is designed for a minimum width of 2 tiles and
cannot cleanly match any area that is only 1 tile thick.</p>

<h3>I created a sprite, but it's not showing up on the map</h3>

<p>The &quot;Initial Instance&quot; box needs to be checked for
an instance of the sprite to automatically be created with the
map. Make sure you have selected the right path and are looking
in the right place for this sprite.</p>

<h3>I'm getting errors when I try to play the game</h3>

<p>You may need to select a different display mode. If you have
selected 24-bit color, maybe your video card doesn't have a
24-bit color mode, only a 32-bit color mode.</p>

<p>You can't jump right into an empty project and try to play a
game that doesn't have any data. At a minimum you must have the
following things defined:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A Tileset</li>
    <li>A Map with at least one layer (which requires the
        existence of the tileset)</li>
    <li>An indication of where the game starts (see <a
        href="Player.htm">player settings dialog</a>)</li>
    <li>A path on the map (to indicate where the player starts)</li>
    <li>A sprite (which includes a sprite template) based on the
        path, to represent the player, with &quot;Initial
        Instance&quot; checked</li>
    <li>An indication of which sprite is the player sprite (see <a
        href="MapEdit4.htm">player map interaction</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>For assistance in creating a very simple project (about the
simplest that can be played) see the quick start tutorial in the
help menu.</p>

<h3>I get a Type Mismatch Error when trying to create something</h3>

<p>Usually this is caused by GameDev trying to read the data off
the dialog to create the object when the data isn't entered. Make
sure you have entered all the appropriate parameters to create
the object and try again.</p>

<h3>What's XML for and how do I use it?</h3>

<p>XML is a plain text data format that can be relatively easily
read and understood by a human reader. You can view an XML file
in notepad or IE5 and above. XML is a general purpose format in
which pretty much any type of data can be stored and described.
The purpose of exporting a game project in XML format might be to
edit a parameter that GameDev doesn't allow you to edit the way
you'd like (if you know what you're doing). It's also a way to
store all your GDP and MAP file data into a single file. It's
used to back up the project in memory while playing the game (so
the state can be restored after playing).</p>

<p>Other tools could easily be written to read, edit and re-save
all or part of GameDev's XML data files. These files could then
be re-imported into GameDev, or used in a separate engine or
editor. Since GameDev is a development kit and not just its own
game engine, it's appropriate to make it expose all its data in
an easily understandable format, so you can do anything with the
data that you want. There is already much information about XML
available on the web, search around. Many things can be done with
XML files.</p>

<p>An XML file exported by GameDev stores all the data normally
stored in the project's GDP file and all the MAP files. It does
not store the content of media clips or tilesets; it expects
those files to exist in the same relative path when the XML file
is imported. The file GameInfo.htm installed with GameDev can be
used to determine an XML file's dependencies. After importing an
XML file, the project will not have a filename because the
filename is normally acquired from the GDP file. Instead it will
receive a temporary default filename of &quot;Imported.gdp&quot;
in the path where the XML file was located, until the project is
saved. GameDev's XML support is not intended as a permanent
storage mechanism so much as an export/import format for using in
external programs.</p>

<p>GameDev requires that XML support be installed on the system
already. In particular is makes use of the
&quot;MSXML.DOMDocument&quot; COM object, which (at least on my
system) is implemented in C:\Windows\System\MSXML.DLL. (I believe
this is delivered with IE5.)</p>
