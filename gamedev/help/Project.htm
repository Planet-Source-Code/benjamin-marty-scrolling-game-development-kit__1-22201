<h2>Scrolling Game Development Kit Project Window</h2>

<p>This is the main window for the program. Closing this closes
all other windows and exits. The view menu (or the third section
of toolbar buttons) is the access point to reach all other
dialogs in the project. The content of the window displays a
hierarchy of the project to give a better visual representation
of how the objects in the project are related. Note that the
hierarchy is not always the internal hierarchy (for instance,
paths do not &quot;own&quot; sprites) -- it's just a convenient
view of the data relationships in the project.</p>

<p>The hierarchy is only updated when a project is loaded, when
&quot;Refresh Tree&quot; is selected from the context menu (right
mouse button) on the tree, or when importing project data from
XML, which can occur after playing the map (to restore the
project's original state). Other than that, the data displayed in
this tree are static. The tree can also be used to navigate to
various elements. By double clicking on an element or
right-clicking and selecting &quot;Go to Item&quot;, the
appropriate dialog for editing the item will come up and load the
specified item.</p>

<p>The File menu allows you to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a new project (erase the current project from
        memory)</li>
    <li>Open an existing project</li>
    <li>Save the current project (and its dependencies)</li>
    <li>Export the project (GDP file and MAP files) to an XML
        file. If you plan to later import the XML file, note that
        it expects the tilesets and media files to be in the same
        relative path when it is re-imported. (These are not part
        of the XML)</li>
    <li>Import the project from XML.</li>
    <li>Play the current game/project. As of version 1.2, this
        can optionally save the current state of the project in
        memory (as an XML string) and restore it while returning
        to the editing environment. (This is the default action.)</li>
    <li><a href="Shortcut.htm">Create a shortcut</a> to run the
        current project</li>
    <li>Exit the program</li>
</ul>

<p>When saving the project, all dependencies must already have a
filename or a dialog will be displayed requesting that you save
them first to assign them a filename. The project save command
will not display dialogs to save all the dependencies, only save
them if they already have assigned paths. This save command
always prompts for the filename, filling in the current filename
by default.</p>

<p>The contents of the view menu are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tilesets: Displays the <a href="TSEdit1.htm">Edit
        Tilesets</a> dialog.</li>

        dialog.</li>

        and Paths</a> dialog.</li>
    <li>Collision Definitions: Displays the <a href="CollDef.htm">Collision
        Definitions</a> dialog.</li>
    <li>Player Settings: Displays the <a href="Player.htm">Player

</ul>

<p>The help menu contains commands to display this help file and
the program's about box. It also provides access to two
tutorials. <strong>At any point in the program you should be able
to press F1 and bring up help applicable to the active window</strong>.</p>
