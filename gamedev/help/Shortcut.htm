<h2>Make Shortcut</h2>

<p>In the file menu (or as a <img src="Images/ShortBtn.gif"
alt="shortcut" width="23" height="22"> button on the toolbar) you
will find a &quot;Make Shortcut&quot; command new with GameDev
version 1.2. It was not feasible or reasonable to make a compiler
(at least for this release) so instead I've exposed the ability
to automatically start up and play a game more obvious.</p>

<p>There are a few parameters involved in creating a shortcut:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Shortcut name.</strong> Specify a display name
        for the shortcut. (Windows derives the filename of the
        shortcut by appending &quot;.lnk&quot; to this name. The
        &quot;.lnk&quot; extension will not be visible from
        Windows, even if you have &quot;show extensions&quot;
        turned on.)</li>
    <li><strong>Path to GameDev.exe.</strong> This is defaulted
        with the name and path of the currently running EXE. This
        is the program that will be used to run the game
        (GameDev.exe). If you know that you will be running
        GameDev.exe from a different directory when you play the
        project you could specify an alternate path here.</li>
    <li><strong>Path to game project.</strong> This is defaulted
        to the name of the currently loaded GDP file, assuming it
        has been saved to a file. This indicates which project
        will be loaded to play when the shortcut is opened.</li>
    <li><strong>Path to script.</strong> If you have created a
        vbs file (similar to the DngnPlay.vbs file used for the
        Sample project) to execute custom script during playback,
        you can specify the path and name of that file here.</li>
    <li><strong>Display mode.</strong> You can use the default
        display mode set up (by the GameDev <a href="Options.htm">options
        dialog</a>) on the target system, or the shortcut can
        override the default and specify a particular color depth
        for the display when running. Be aware that overriding
        the display mode to force 24-bit color (for instance) may
        make the shortcut unusable on systems where 24-bit color
        is not supported (my video card, for instance, only
        supports 16-bit and 32-bit).</li>
</ul>

<p>After entering all the parameters, clicking OK will create the
shortcut on the desktop and close the dialog. When you open the
shortcut, it will start up GameDev in playback mode, load the
specified project, play the game (or run the script) and then
exit. There is no opportunity to edit the game project during
this sequence.</p>

<p>The shortcut depends on the absolute path of GameDev.exe and
the GDP file so it may not be reasonable to copy this shortcut to
play the game on other systems, unless you had the other
system(s) in mind when specifying the paths to GameDev.exe and
the GDP file.</p>
