<h2>Multimedia Manager</h2>

<p>This dialog can be used to include media clips in the project
and to assign these media clips to background music for maps and
sound effects for special functions.</p>

<p>To add a new clip:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Under &quot;Clip name&quot; assign it a name by which it
        can be referred to within the project.</li>
    <li>Locate the file containing the media in &quot;Media
        file&quot; (path relative to the GDP file).</li>
    <li>Check &quot;Keep loaded&quot; if the clip should be kept
        in memory, for instance, to continue playing it where
        playback was left off while halting the clip to play
        another clip, or to make this clip play faster.</li>
    <li>Check &quot;Play looping&quot; to make this clip start
        over when its done playing (good for background music).</li>
    <li>Check &quot;Modal&quot; if you want the game to freeze
        while the media clip is played (required for video clips)</li>
    <li>Check &quot;Suspend other media to play&quot; if you want
        all other sound to fade out before starting this clip,
        and te re-start when this clip is done (good for clips
        that are too complicated for some sound cards to handle
        simultaneously).</li>
    <li>Adjust the volume. Note that anything below the top few
        pixels may be inaudible on some or most (or all?) sound
        cards currently available. The whole scale was included
        because according to Microsoft documentation, the
        framework can support 10,000 volume levels.</li>
    <li>Assign an X and Y if this is a video clip. The clip will
        play in its native size, so make sure that there's enough
        room on a 640x480 display for the whole rectangle to
        appear on screen given the X and Y for top and left.</li>
    <li>Click the &quot;Add Clip&quot; button.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;Assign Media&quot; tab allows you to associate media
clips with certain aspects of the game. To set the background
music for a particular map, select the map from the
&quot;Maps&quot; dropdown list, then select the clip that should
play as background music for that map. The path is relative to
the path of the GDP file.</p>

<p>The other aspect to which a multimedia clip can be assigned is
a special function. A special function can cause a media clip to
start playing or stop playing, or it can change the media
associated with the background music clip. To assign a media clip
to a special function, select the function from the list. Then
select &quot;Play clip&quot; or &quot;Stop clip&quot; and pick a
media clip from the &quot;Function media clip&quot; dropdown
list. Changes take effect immediately and do not need to be
applied.</p>

<p>When a clip is stopped, if its &quot;Keep loaded&quot;
attribute is set, it will remember it's current position and
resume playing from the same position when the clip is played
again. If &quot;Keep loaded&quot; is not set, the clip will be
completely unloaded from memory and, if played again, will be
reloaded and started from the beginning.</p>

<p>Changing the background music is a bit different. The
background music does not change from one clip to another clip,
but instead changes the media associated with the clip set as the
&quot;Background music&quot; clip. So when a function is set to
change the background music it requires a filename rather than a
clip name. When the function is activated the current background
music will fade out, the new media file will be loaded, and the
new background music will start. This all happens without
changing the clip associated with the map's &quot;Background
music&quot; attribute.</p>

<p>All media clip information (except the clip itself, which is
its own media file) is stored in the project file. A special
function's reference to a media clip, however is stored in the
map with the special function itself. This is one of the many
reasons the GDP file and the MAP files need to be in sync.</p>

<p>As of version 1.2 there are a couple other events with which
media clips can be associated. A <a href="CollDef.htm">collision
definition</a> can trigger a media clip to play, as can a <a
href="MapEdit4.htm">player map interaction</a>. These
associations are stored in the MAP file. Rather than defining
these in the media clips dialog, they are defined in their
respective dialogs.</p>
