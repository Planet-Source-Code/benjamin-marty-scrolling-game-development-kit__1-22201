<h2>Define Tile Matching</h2>

<p>This dialog is where Tilematch objects are defined. A
Tilematch object is used in the <a href="MapEdit3.htm">map editor</a>
to quickly and easily construct coherent structures. This is
accomplished by defining which tiles belong in which locations
near the exterior edges of structures.</p>

<p><img src="Images/TileMach.GIF" align="right" hspace="6"
width="359" height="466">The Tilematch object has 15 internal
categories of tiles. These 15 categories cover all the needs to
match neighboring tiles for any structure that is always at least
2 tiles thick (minimum of a 2-by-2 structure). Each category may
contain a number of tiles, one of which is chosen randomly at the
time the matching is done. The ability to contain multiple tiles
in each category only exists for variety; a perfectly good
Tilematch can be defined with only one tile in each category. The
list below lists all 15 categories in order from top left to
bottom right, and describes when the category is used:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Top-left corner: Tiles above and left are not members of
        the Tilematch; tiles below and right are members of the
        Tilematch.</li>
    <li>Top center: Tiles above are not members of the Tilematch;
        tiles below, left and right are members.</li>
    <li>Top-right corner: Tiles above and right are not members
        of the Tilematch, tiles below and left are.</li>
    <li>Southeast inner corner: Tiles on all sides are members of
        the Tilematch except the tile above and to the left.</li>
    <li>Southwest inner corner: Tiles on all sides are members of
        the Tilematch except the tile above and to the right.</li>
    <li>Left center: Tiles to the left are not members of the
        Tilematch; tiles below, above and to the right are.</li>
    <li>Center: Tiles on all sides are members of the Tilematch.</li>
    <li>Right center: Tiles above left and below are members of
        the Tilematch, but tiles to the right are not.</li>
    <li>Northeast inner corner: Tiles on all sides are members of
        the Tilematch except the tile below and left.</li>
    <li>Northwest inner corner: Tiles on all sides are members of
        the Tilematch except the tile tile below and right.</li>
    <li>Bottom-left corner: Tiles above and to the right are
        members of the tilematch, but tiles below and to the left
        are not.</li>
    <li>Bottom center: Tiles left, right and above are members of
        the Tilematch, but tiles below are not.</li>
    <li>Bottom-right corner: Tiles above and left are members of
        the Tilematch, but tiles below and right are not.</li>
    <li>Northwest-southeast joiner: Tiles on all sides are
        members of the tilematch except the tile above-right and
        the tile below-left.</li>
    <li>Northeast-southwest joiner: Tiles on all sides are
        members of the tilematch except the tile above-left and
        the tile below-right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that when the tile matching dialog is initially
displayed, it contains some simplistic graphics in each of the
categories. These are meant only to represent the kind of tile
that would belong in that slot and do not indicate any content.
Once a slot is filled in with one or more tiles, the first tile
in the category associated with that slot will be used to
represent that slot instead of the simplified graphic. The tile
may appear somewhat distorted because it is stretched or
condensed to fit inside the slot's representation. Tiles can be
added to a category either by dragging the tile from the
&quot;Tiles available in tileset&quot; box directly to the slot
for the category, or by clicking the slot and dragging the tile
into the &quot;Tiles in current slot&quot; box.</p>

<p>When using a Tilematch in the map editor, it always uses a
2-by-2 &quot;brush&quot; so that it's not possible to draw an
incoherent structure. (This can, however, occur when using the
Tilematch eraser.) The tiles are selected based on the
surrounding tiles on the map. A 4-by-4 square may be altered to
match the 2-by-2 block being drawn. Each individual tile in the
4-by-4 area is selected based on the surrounding tiles according
to the rules above. The Tilematch object forces the middle 4
tiles to be the center tile. Then it performs the matching,
changing these 4 center tiles to match their surroundings if
necessary.</p>

<p>The matching does not end there. Because some tiles around the
edge of the 4-by-4 area may need to be altered to match the
center 4 tiles, all their neighboring tiles need to be considered
in order to determine exactly how they match their surroundings.
Therefore in the end, a 6-by-6-tile area is considered in drawing
one click of Tilematch. So starting at the center, there are 3
layers of effect that using a Tilematch has:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Layer 1: The center 4 tiles are hard-set according to the
        selected tilematch</li>
    <li>Leyer 2: The next 12 tiles are only altered to match the
        center 4 tiles, but will not be altered to become a tile
        within the Tilematch if they are not already a member.</li>
    <li>Layer 3: These 20 tiles are never changed, only observed
        in order that the rest of the tiles change to the
        appropriate values.</li>
</ul>

<p>This said, you may understand the need for one more category.
&quot;Unclassified tiles in this group&quot; is a category that
can be used to indicate tiles (in layers 2 and 3 as described
above) that match up with tiles in this Tilematch, or can be
altered because they are visually part of the same kind of
structure, but which are never drawn onto the screen by this
Tilematch. They are considered part of the Tilematch, but are not
drawn under any circumstances by the Tilematch itself. For
instance, if you have one Tilematch object that has square
corners (call it &quot;SquareMatch&quot;) and another that has
sloped corners (as depicted in the screenshot above -- call it
&quot;SlopeMatch&quot;), you would probably want to add the
sloped corners to the &quot;Unclassified&quot; category in
&quot;SquareMatch&quot; and add the square corners to the
&quot;Unclassified&quot; category in &quot;SlopeMatch&quot;. This
allows two similar looking Tilematches to join together
seamlessly.</p>

<p>To remove a tile from a category, select the appropriate slot
and drag the tile from &quot;Tiles in current slot&quot; or
&quot;Unclassified tiles in this group&quot; to &quot;Tiles
available in tileset&quot;.</p>
