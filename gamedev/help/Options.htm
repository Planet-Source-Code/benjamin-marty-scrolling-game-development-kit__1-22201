<h2>GameDev Options</h2>

<p>This simple dialog (new with version 1.2) allows you to
specify some global paremeters relating to the editing
environment:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Disable player edits in map editor</strong>. This
        option, when checked, has the following effects <strong>only</strong>
        while in the full screen map editor (the Play command
        from the file menu still functions normally). <ul>
            <li>When a collision test that involves inventory
                occurs, the player's inventory is not changed.</li>
            <li>When any &quot;Alter Map&quot; type function is
                triggered, it will have no effect on map tiles.</li>
            <li>For functions that have &quot;Remove after
                use&quot; checked, the function is not removed.</li>
            <li>For functions that require inventory to activate,
                the inventory is not altered by the activation of
                the special function.</li>
            <li>All <a href="MapEdit4.htm">player map
                interactions</a> are completely disabled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any changes that *do* take place while the map editor
        is active are permanent and will be persisted to file
        when the project/map is saved.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Display warning message before playing map</strong>.
        Using the &quot;Play&quot; command from within the editor
        environment can be risky. This is one reason for having
        the new &quot;Make Shortcut&quot; command in version 1.2.
        Running the game from a shortcut plays the game in a
        separate process. When playing the game in a separate
        process, the game is loaded from a file and never saved
        so there is no risk of corrupting the project or making
        unintended permanent changes. For this reason I decided
        to display a warning message whenever the play command is
        selected from withing the GameDev development
        environment. Realizing, however, that this message could
        quickly become very annoying to more experienced
        developers who know what they're doing, this option is
        provided to turn that message off. GameDev does its best
        to store and restore the project each time the Play
        command is executed from within the development
        environment, but who can predict everything that might
        happen.</li>
    <li><strong>Store project backup in memory while playing</strong>.
        By default, GameDev attempts to export the current
        project (all data stored in the GDP and MAP files) into
        an XML string in memory before executing the Play command
        from within the development environment. When control
        returns to the development environment, GameDev will
        re-import all data from the XML string back into the
        active project, undoing any changes that may have
        occurred while playing the game. There are a few reasons
        you might want to disable this:<ul>
            <li>If you are working on a large project, exporting
                the data to an XML string might be time consuming
                and a real memory hog.</li>
            <li>You might want the changes that take place during
                play to be permanent.</li>
            <li>You might not have an XML parser installed (I
                believe that comes with IE5.0 and later).</li>
            <li>There might be (*gasp*) an undiscovered bug in
                the process that results in imperfect restoration
                of the project.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Default full screen display mode.</strong> Some
        video cards do not support 24-bit color, others do not
        support 32-bit color, but most seem to support 16-bit
        color so I originally settled on this as a hard coded
        default for playing games and editing maps and graphics.
        But if one neglected to select 24- or 32-bit color before
        editing a tileset, the tileset would lose valuable color
        information. Furthermore, there was no method, short of
        writing a vbs script, to play the game in 24- or 32-bit
        color. For these reasons I have added this option in
        order to supply an easy way to indicate to GameDev which
        video mode you want to use most often. This mode will be
        selected by default when editing tilesets and maps. The
        option to select a mode other than the default still
        exists on the editor dialogs. A command line switch has
        also been added so that playing a game can also select a
        particular video mode, or use the user's default
        specified in this dialog. That command line switch is
        utilized by the <a href="Shortcut.htm">Make Shortcut</a>
        command.</li>
</ul>
