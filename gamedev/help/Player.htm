<h2>Player Settings</h2>

<p>This dialog is used to define the map where gameplay starts,
what the inventory looks and acts like, and a few other global
gameplay-related settings.</p>

<p>First of all the player needs to know where to start the game.
All this requires is an indication of which map the game starts
on. The map itself knows the starting position for the player
sprite. Then there are a couple miscellaneous global settings
used by the player. The scroll margins determine how many pixels
there are between the edge of the map display and the edge of the
player sprite before the map starts to scroll. The smaller these
values are, the closer the edge of the sprite can get to the edge
of the display area before causing the map to scroll. The map
will stop scrolling if the player reaches the edge of the map.
The player can then travel right up to the edge of the display if
the map solidity allows it (even off the edge, so make sure the
edges are solid). The &quot;Quantity Margin&quot; determines how
certain aspects of the inventory are displayed. This margin is
used to separate the icon (or word) representing an inventory
item from the bar or text indicating the quantity owned.</p>

<p>The remainder of the dialog is dedicated to defining the
inventory. To create an inventory item, first enter all the
parameters for the item, then click New to create the item and
add it to the project using the given parameters. The list below
describes the parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name: The name by which this inventory item can be
        referred to within the project. This name must be unique
        within the space of all inventory item names in the
        project.</li>
    <li>Icon Tileset: If the inventory display for this item is
        represented by a tile, this indicates the tileset in
        which the tile is contained.</li>
    <li>Icon Index: This selects an individual tile from the
        tileset that will be used to represent the item in the
        inventory display. Use the arrows to cycle through the
        tiles in the tileset. The currently selected tile is
        displayed below the field.</li>
    <li>Max Quantity: Determines the maximum number of this item
        that the player can own.</li>
    <li>Initial Quantity: Determines how many of this item the
        player owns when the game begins.</li>
    <li>Quantity Display: Determines how this inventory item is
        displayed. See below (after this list) for a detailed
        description of each option.</li>
    <li>Icon count per repetition (M): If Quantity Display is set
        to &quot;Index to M; repeat...&quot; this value
        determines how many sequential tiles there are in the
        tileset representing various quantities of this item. For
        instance if you have one tile representing a single key
        and another tile right after that representing two keys,
        you would set the icon index to the tile for the single
        key. Then set this value to 2. Then when the player has 3
        keys, two tiles will be drawn to represent the quantity
        owned of this item: one depicting two keys and one
        depicting one key.</li>
    <li>Bar Color: If a bar is used to represent quantity owned
        for this item, this is the color of the bar.</li>
    <li>Bar Background: The bar has a fixed maximum size. The
        background of the bar always occupies the entire maximum
        size while the bar itself represents what portion of the
        maximum is owned. This setting determines this background
        color.</li>
    <li>Bar Outline: If the background is insufficient to set off
        the bar from the background of the display, you can add
        an outline of any color around the edge of the bar
        background.</li>
    <li>Bar Length: Determines how long, in pixels, the maximum
        langth of the bar is. For vertical bars, this is the
        height and for horizontal bars this is the width. This
        size determines how big the bar background is.</li>
    <li>Bar Thickness: Determines how thick, in pixels, the bar
        background and bar are. For a vertical bar this is the
        width and for a horizontal bar this is the height.</li>
    <li>Coordinates to display inventory item: Where on the
        display the inventory item should be drawn. This may
        overlap the map since the inventory is drawn after the
        map is drawn. Just make sure that whatever X,Y
        coordinates you choose, there is sufficient room for the
        icon, the margin, and the display of the quantity.
        Remember the screen resolution is 640x480.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;Quantity Display&quot; field deserves a more
detailed description. Many of the other parameters interact with
and depend on the value in this field. Listed below are the
different values for Quantity Display.</p>

<ul>
    <li>None: Do not display this item in the inventory, just
        track ownership of the item invisibly.</li>
    <li>Horizontal bar above: Display the item's icon at the
        specified coordinates, and display the quantity owned of
        this item with a horizontal bar above the icon according
        to the specified &quot;Bar&quot; parameters. The bar is
        aligned with the left side of the icon and fills from
        left to right.</li>
    <li>Horizontal bar below: Display the item's icon at the
        specified coordinates, and display the quantity owned of
        this item with a horizontal bar below the icon according
        to the specified &quot;Bar&quot; parameters. The bar is
        aligned with the left side of the icon and fills from
        left to right</li>
    <li>Horizontal bar at right: Display the item's icon at the
        specified coordinates, and display the quantity owned of
        this item with a horizontal bar to the right of the icon
        according to the specified &quot;Bar&quot; parameters.
        The bar is centered at the right side of the icon and
        fills from left to right.</li>
    <li>Vertical bar above: Display the item's icon at the
        specified coordinates, and display the quantity owned of
        this item with a vertical bar above the icon according to
        the specified &quot;Bar&quot; parameters. The bar is
        centered above the icon and fills from bottom to top.</li>
    <li>Vertical bar at right: Display the item's icon at the
        specified coordinates, and display the quantity owned of
        this item with a vertical bar to the right of the icon
        according to the specified &quot;Bar&quot; parameters.
        The bar in aligned with the bottom of the icon and fills
        from bottom to top.</li>
    <li>Vertical bar at left: Display the item's icon at the
        specified coordinates, and display the quantity owned of
        this item with a vertical bar to the left of the icon
        according to the specified &quot;Bar&quot; parameters.
        The bar is aligned with the bottom of the icon and fills
        from bottom to top.</li>
    <li>Text above: Display the item's icon at the specified
        coordinates, and display the quantity owned of this item
        as numeric text above the icon. Text is aligned with the
        left side of the icon.</li>
    <li>Text below: Display the item's icon at the specified
        coordinates, and display the quantity owned of this item
        as numeric text below the icon. The text is aligned with
        the left side of the icon.</li>
    <li>Text at left: Display the item's icon at the specified
        coordinates, and display the quantity owned of this item
        as numeric text to the left of the icon. The text is
        centered to the left of the icon.</li>
    <li>Text at right: Display the item's icon at the specified
        coordinates, and display the quantity owned of this item
        as numeric text to the right of the icon. The text is
        centered to the right of the icon.</li>
    <li>Repeat icon to right: The icon is drawn at the specified
        coordinates if the player owns at least one. Quantity
        Owned determines how many more icons are drawn to the
        right of it. The total number of icons drawn represent
        the number owned by the player. Obviously this only works
        for items with small maximum quantities. For each item
        that the player *could* own, but does not own, tile
        number 0 (from the same tileset) is drawn in that
        position instead. (MaxQuantity tiles are always drawn
        onto the screen, Quantity Owned determines how many are
        the specified icon vs. tile #0)</li>
    <li>Repeat icon above: Same as &quot;Repeat icon to
        right&quot; except additional items/slots are drawn above
        the first one.</li>
    <li>Repeat icon below: Same as &quot;Repeat icon to
        right&quot; except additional items/slots are drawn below
        the first one.</li>
    <li>Increase icon index: A tile is always drawn at the
        specified coordinates. If the player does not own any of
        the item, the specified tile is drawn. If the player owns
        one of the item, the following tile is drawn etc. The
        count of the item owned by the player is added to the
        tile index drawn.</li>
    <li>Index to M; repeat at right: This is somewhat similar to
        &quot;Repeat icon to right&quot;, but each
        &quot;slot&quot; can represent more than 1 item. If M
        (specified in the field under &quot;Quantity
        Display&quot;) is 2 for instance, the following will be
        true: owning 1 of this item is represented by the
        specified icon being drawn once; owning 2 is represented
        by the subsequent icon being drawn once; owning 3 is
        represented by the subsequent tile being drawn once and
        then the specified icon being drawn to the right; owning
        4 is represented by the subsequent tile being drawn once
        at the specified coordinates and once to the right. The
        remainder of the space that could be occupied (indicated
        by MaxCount divided by M) is filled in with tile number 0
        when not used.</li>
    <li>Index to M; repeat above: Same as &quot;Index to M;
        repeat at right&quot; except additional tiles/slots are
        positioned above the first.</li>
    <li>Index to M; repeat below: Same as &quot;Index to M;
        repeat at right&quot; except additional tiles/slots are
        positioned below the first.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an inventory item does not specify a tileset, the item name
text will be used to represent it in the inventory display
(Quantity Display in this case should be bar or text).</p>

<p>The arrow buttons at the bottom of the dialog can be used to
navigate through existing inventory items. New creates a new item
based on the displayed parameters and adds it to the project.
Delete deletes the currently displayed item (indicated by the
index in the title of the frame: &quot;Inventory Item 1 of
2&quot; for instance). The Update button updates the current item
to the displayed parameters. The arrow buttons do an implicit
update before moving to the new item, as does the OK button.</p>

<p>Since all these parameters are project-wide they are saved in
the GDP (project) file and have no connection to a map, except
that the starting map name must exist in the proect.</p>
