<h2>Tile Animation</h2>

<p>This dialog allows you to define how map tiles animate.
Because the map is completely redrawn for every frame anyway, you
should be able to animate every visible tile without visibly
reducing the speed at which GameDev plays or edits a map.</p>

<p>The process of defining a new tile animation generally follows
these steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select a map from the &quot;Available Maps&quot; list.</li>
    <li>Select a layer within that map from the &quot;Layers in
        Map&quot; list. (An animation applies to a specific
        layer. Even other layers that use the same tileset will
        not animate unless they also have tile animation(s)
        defined.)</li>
    <li>Click the &quot;New Anim.&quot; button.</li>
    <li>Enter a name for the new tile animation definition. This
        name should be unique in within the space of all tile
        animations in the project.</li>
    <li>When the tiles appropriate to the layer appear in the
        &quot;Tiles in Layer's Tileset&quot; box, drag a
        &quot;base tile&quot; into the &quot;Tile to
        Animate&quot; box. This &quot;base tile&quot; defines
        which tile on the map will be replaced with the animation
        you're about to define. Since the map can only contain
        single-byte values, you have to replace one of these
        values (the &quot;base&quot; tile for the animation) with
        the animation, you can't have 255 tiles <strong>and</strong>
        additional animations. So when you want to place an
        animated tile on the map, you place this base tile there
        to put the animation at that position.</li>
    <li>Drag a sequence of tiles from the tileset box into the
        &quot;Animation Frames&quot; box. A vertical
        &quot;cursor&quot; is displayed as the mouse hovers over
        the Animation Frames box, indicating where the new tile
        will be inserted.</li>
    <li>Finally, enter delay values for each frame to achieve the
        appropriate animation speed. The tile animation is
        updated as it is edited and does not need to be
        explicitly saved or updated in the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also drag and re-arrange the tiles within the
Animation Frames box. If you do not hold the shift key while
dragging within the Animation Frames box, the tile will be copied
to the new location (indicated by the &quot;+&quot; on the drag
pointer). Hold shift to move a tile to a new location in the
animation sequence. To remove a frame from the animation frames
sequence, drag it back into the tileset tiles box. Multiple tiles
can be dragged at once by first selecting them while holding the
Ctrl key. Tile images can also be dragged into external
applications, but only one at a time.</p>

<p>The &quot;Preview&quot; box displays a rough estimate of how
the tile will look when it shows up on the map. The actual speed
of the animation is hard to estimate, but the preview should get
the relative delays of the frames correct. If you have troubles
making the preview animate, check that the <a href="Sprites1.htm">Sprites
and Paths</a> dialog is not up. The sprites and paths dialog also
has an animated preview, and because of the way the previews are
handled, only one preview can animate at a time.</p>

<p>To edit an existing animation, bring this dialog up, select
the map and layer in which it is defined, and then select the
name of the tile animation. The appropriate tiles will
automatically be loaded and the animated preview will be started.
You can then manipulate the delays and/or the tiles in the
&quot;Animation Frames&quot; list immediately, or specify a new
base tile.</p>

<p>Tile animation is accomplished by remapping one tile value to
another. The BMDXCtls graphics engine on which GameDev is based
keeps a list of 255 mappings (one for each tile value). This
mapping indicates when another tile should be drawn instead of
the tile index associated with the byte at a particular position
in the map. For every tile it draws on the map, it looks in this
mapping array at the appropriate position. Instead of directly
drawing the tile associated with the byte index, it uses the
mapping to get a tile index for the byte value. All GameDev has
to do then is manipulate this mapping array, cycling the mappings
according to the animation definition; it does not have to
iterate through each tile and change its appearance. This results
in an insignificant amount of work to animate a single tile or a
whole screen full of tiles based on a single animation
definition.</p>

<p>All tile animation information (except, of course, the tile
graphics themselves) is stored in the GDP project file.</p>
