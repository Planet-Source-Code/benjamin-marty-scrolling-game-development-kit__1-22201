<h2>Controller Configuration</h2>

<p>This dialog allows you to define which keys are used to
control sprites set to be controlled by &quot;Input device&quot;.
To specify a key for the given field, set focus to that field
with the tab key or the mouse, then press the key. Some keys may
not be usable at all (for instance the tab key), but most are.
Some keys, instead of displaying the name of the key will display
the code associated with the key, but that key will,
nevertheless, function normally.</p>

<p>Although 4 buttons are definable, only the first is
intrinsically supported by GameDev functionality. The other
buttons may be detected and reacted to from within script code.</p>

<p>Checking the &quot;Enable Joystick&quot; box allows the
directions of the joystick to also affect the &quot;input
device&quot;. The state of the &quot;input device&quot; as
sprites see it is a combination of the keyboard and the state of
the joystick when this box is checked. Currently, the joy stick
cannot be further configured, and the directions do exactly the
same thing as the keys mapped to the four directions.</p>

<p>These settings are saved in the GDP project file.</p>
