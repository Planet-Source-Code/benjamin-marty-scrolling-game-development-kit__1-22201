<h2>Player Map Interactions</h2>

<p>This is part of a series of pages describing the <a
href="MapEdit1.htm">Edit Maps Dialog</a>. This page describes the
Player Interaction tab.</p>

<p>Here you can define which sprite is the player sprite (which
sprite causes the map to scroll), and how this sprite can
interact with map tiles using inventory. Selecting a sprite as
the player sprite is not related to what controls that sprite. A
player sprite can be controlled automatically or by the input
device. The main features of the player sprite are that it causes
the map to scroll and it is the one sprite that can interact with
tiles and special functions.</p>

<p>To select a player sprite, you must have a sprite with the
&quot;Initial Instance&quot; option checked. The player sprite
must be created with the map, so only &quot;Initial
Instance&quot; sprites are listed as selections in the first
field. The remainder of the tab is dedicated to defining
interactions between the player sprite and various categories of
map tiles. The player sprite must be specified before
interactions can be defined because many aspects of the
interaction depend on properties of the player sprite (especially
the layer on which the player sprite resides). Defining an
interaction consists of entering the parameters for the
interaction and then clicking the &quot;New&quot; button to add
these parameters to the map as a new interaction definition. The
arrow buttons at the bottom can be used to scroll through
existing interactons.</p>

<p>The first field in the Map Interaction frame is used to
specify a tile category which triggers the interaction. All
interactions are based on a tile category, even if the
interaction is only concerned with a single tile. For information
on creating tile categories, see <a href="GrpTile.htm">Tile
Categories</a>. The interaction is triggered whenever the player
touches any tile in the category specified in this field. If the
player touches multiple tiles in this category at the same time,
the interaction is triggered for each tile in sequence.</p>

<p>The &quot;Initially&quot; option indicates that this
interaction should only be triggered when the player initially
touches the tile, and should not be triggered again unless the
player stops touching the tile and then starts again. The
&quot;Continuously&quot; option indicates that the interaction
should be constantly triggered (each frame advance of the game)
as long as the player continues to touch this tile and as long as
the tile continues to be a member of the category. (If the tile
changes to a tile not in the category, the interaction will not
continue to be triggered by it.)</p>

<p>After these two options is a field in which you can indicate
the kind of effect this interaction will have:</p>

<ul>
    <li>No Effect on Inventory: This option might make sense for
        an interaction that is only used for script code.</li>
    <li>Add Item to Inventory: This is usually the case when
        you're defining what an inventory item looks like on the
        map. This interaction would probably consist of removing
        the tile from the map and adding the item to the
        inventory.</li>
    <li>Subtract Item from Inventory: This uses up an item in the
        inventory to perform the interaction.</li>
    <li>Use Item Without Subtracting: This ensures that the
        player owns the specified item, but does not remove the
        item from the inventory to perform the interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Relavent inventory item refers to an item defined in the <a
href="Player.htm">Player Settings Dialog</a>. For actions (listed
above) that involve the inventory, this field indicates which
item is involved. If &quot;No effect on inventory&quot; was
selected, then the &quot;Relavent inventory item&quot; setting is
irrelavent. However it is still stored with the interaction. This
piece of information could be set and then used by script code if
the interaction raises an event. The script code might have use
for a reference to an inventory item.</p>

<p>&quot;Remove tile if inventory OK&quot; will change the map
tile:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If &quot;Add item to inventory&quot; is selected and the
        player does not have the maximum number they can hold of
        the specified item .</li>
    <li>If &quot;Subtract item from inventory&quot; or &quot;Use
        item without subtracting&quot; is selected and the player
        has 1 or more of the specified item.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Don't remove&quot; will never alter the map tile in
response to this interaction (perhaps this is where you can
always fill up on a particular item). &quot;Always remove&quot;
will remove the tile from the map whenever the player touches it,
regardless of the player's inventory.</p>

<p>Below these options is a setting to indicate what the tile is
changed to when it is &quot;removed&quot;. A tile cannot simply
be removed from the map because every pixel on the layer must map
to *some* tile. If you want to replace the tile with background,
then &quot;0&quot; is the appropriate value here. However, it's
possible to replace this tile with any other tile when the tile
is removed. The new tile could in turn trigger another
interaction (if the &quot;Continuously&quot; option is selected).
So chains of interactions could be build up on a single type of
tile.</p>

<p>To specify a particular sound effect to play when the tile
interaction activates, select a media clip from the list after
&quot;Play media clip:&quot;. </p>

<p>Finally, the &quot;Raise an event for this interaction&quot;
determines whether the OnTileInteraction event should be
triggered whenever the player touches a tile in the specified
category for this interaction. If this is checked, the X and Y
coordinates of the tile (in tile coordinates, not pixels), tile
value, &quot;NewTouch&quot; flag and Interaction index are passed
to the event. The &quot;NewTouch&quot; flag indicates whether the
player has just started touching the tile (true) or if the player
was already touching it (false). The interaction index indicates
the ordinal index of the interaction within the map, so the same
interaction definition can be located in the script code if need
be.</p>

<p>The New button creates a new interaction definition based on
the paremeters currently entered. The Delete button deletes the
current interaction (indicated in the title of the &quot;Map
Interaction&quot; frame). The Update button updates the current
interaction (indicated in the title of the &quot;Map
Interaction&quot; frame) to the entered parameters.
&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; goes to the first interaction,
&quot;&lt;&quot; to the previous interaction, &quot;&gt;&quot; to
the next interaction, and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; to the last.</p>
