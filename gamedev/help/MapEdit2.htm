<h2>Editing Map Layers</h2>

<p>This is part of a series of pages describing the <a
href="MapEdit1.htm">Edit Maps Dialog</a>. This page describes the
Layers tab.</p>

<p>The map layers are where the main content of a map is really
stored. Each Layer object contains an array of tiles which define
the contents of an entire area covering the map. Multiple layers
can be defined to represent foreground and background layers of
the map, and they can scroll at different speeds. The size of the
layer (fundamentally defined in tiles) is determined entirely by
the map its contained in. This size is calculated when the layer
is created or updated. A lower scroll rate, for instance, will
result in a layer requiring fewer tiles than a similar layer with
a higher scroll rate. In order for the layer to have content
accross the entire area of a map, it's necessary for a faster
scrolling layer to have more content.</p>

<p>To create a layer, you must first select a map which will own
the layer. Then enter a name for the layer (which must be unique
in the space of layer names for this map). Select a tileset which
the layer uses. The tiles of each layer are restricted to the 256
(maximum) tiles contained in a tileset. (If you need more tiles
you can add another transparent layer with the same scroll rate
using a different tileset.) The X scroll rate and Y scroll rate
indicate how fast the layer scrolls relative to the map. It's a
good idea for your main layer (where the player is and probably
where all the action takes place) to have values of 1 here. Any
layer that scrolls slower than this would have values between 0
and 1, and any layer than scrolls faster would have a value
greater than 1. Don't get carried away with scroll rates.
Remember that a faster scrolling layer requires more tiles. If
you have a map that's 16,000 pixels x 16,000 pixels, and that
layer's tileset uses tiles that are 16x16 pixels, a layer that
scrolls at a rate of 1,1 would require about 1 MB while a layer
that scrolls at a rate of 2,2 would require about 4 MB.</p>

<p>The last option to select for a layer is the &quot;Transparent
layer&quot; checkbox. You should always have exactly one layer
that is not transparent, and the remainder of the layers should
have this box checked. And of course, if you want to see all
these layers, the transparent layers should all be on top of the
non-transparent layer.</p>

<p>The &quot;Screen Depth&quot; here is not a persistent
property. It is only used to determine what video mode to use
when the Edit button is clicked. The Edit button will display <a
href="MapEdit3.htm">The Full Screen Map Editor</a>. Use the
&quot;Update Layer&quot; button whenever you have clicked on a
layer and made changes to its properties. All layer information
and parameters are stored within the MAP file.</p>
