<h2>Technical Support and Contact Information</h2>

<p>The Scrolling Game Development Kit has a web site at <a
href="http://gamedev.sourceforge.net/">http://gamedev.sourceforge.net/</a>.
It is also an open source project maintained on the web at <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gamedev/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gamedev/</a>
(the same site that hosts the main web site). The open source web
site has places to report bugs, ask questions, download the
latest code and so forth. If you are unable to contact the web
site, the author can be contacted via e-mail directly at <a
href="mailto:BlueMonkMN@email.com">BlueMonkMN@email.com</a>. </p>

<p>If you would like to contact the author of The Scrolling Game
Development Kit for any other reason, feel free to e-mail at <a
href="mailto:BlueMonkMN@email.com">BlueMonkMN@email.com</a>. This
is my address and I was responsible for all aspects of GameDev:
the design and development of GameDev, supporting DLL's
(BMDXCtls.dll and ScrHost.dll), the tutorial, all documentation
(as of this writing) and the content of the
gamedev.sourceforge.net web site.</p>

<p>For support on VBScript, see <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/</a>.
Scripting support in GameDev is not currently fully documented,
but I will be happy to answer specific questions at the open
source web site, or if neccessary, directly to my e-mail address.
Using the object viewer in Visual Basic, looking at the <a
href="Tut9.htm">last step in the tutorial</a> and viewing the
source code are the only ways to learn about scripting support at
the moment.</p>
