<h2><font face="Verdana">GameDev Tutorial</font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana">This tutorial will lead you through the
steps of creating a simple game using GameDev, the Scrolling Game
Development Kit. In the process you will see how various aspects
of the program function. The following is an overview of the
steps we will take:</font></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="6">

                the graphics.</font></a><font face="Verdana">
                Almost everything in GameDev is directly or
                indirectly dependent on graphics. These graphics
                are called Tilesets. GameDev stores images of all
                the tiles in memory (or in files) and loads them
                into display memory when the map editor or game
                player is invoked. Tilesets are used for map
                tiles and sprite graphics alike.</font></li>

                tile matching properties.</font></a><font
                face="Verdana"> Using tile matching, the creation
                of a professional looking map can proceed very
                quickly. Tile matching, when properly defined,
                will automatically match a 2-by-2 square of tiles
                to the surrounding map. This allows you to draw
                cohesive structures without constantly having to
                change the tile currently being drawn.</font></li>

            <li><a href="Tut3.htm"><font face="Verdana">Create a
                map.</font></a><font face="Verdana"> Maps can
                have multiple layers in the Scrolling Game
                Development Kit. Layers can scroll at different
                rates. Maps are central to the game. They contain
                all the paths and sprites and special functions.
                The map editor has the ability to generate random
                mazes built into it, which will help to generate
                an interesting map very quickly.</font></li>

                tile categories and solidity.</font></a><font
                face="Verdana"> Tiles can be grouped into
                categories. These categories are useful for
                determining which tiles are solid and what their
                shapes are like. This allows the player and other
                sprites to interact with the shape of the map. A
                solidity definition can consist of slanted and
                square tiles. These solidity definitions are then
                associated with sprites which use it to interact
                with the map in a way appropriate to the
                particular sprite.</font></li>

                face="Verdana"> Paths are defined in the map
                editor. They can then be linked to sprite
                definitions. There are various ways that sprites
                can move and interact with other sprites and the
                map. Even though every sprite is associated with
                a path, not every sprite needs to follow the path
                associated with it. Even the main player sprite
                has a path, just to determine the starting
                position.</font></li>

                for which GameDev handles inventory and complex
                map interaction. Complex interactions include
                information about which tiles grant and use

                Special functions allow the developer to define
                some very specific events that can occur while
                playing the game. These functions include
                teleporting the player, creating sprites,
                displaying messages or images, altering the map,
                and deleting sprites to mention a few.</font></li>

                own media file in response to an event. Video
                clips are also supported. As of version 1.2,
                media clips can be associated with sprite
                collisions and tile interactions too. The Media
                Manager in GameDev smoothly fades between
                changing media, automatically fading out audio
                when appropriate.</font></li>

                of the project, and other aspects of the gaming
                engine. Events raised by objects can also be
                trapped and responded to by script code.
                Scripting can be used for very specific control
