<h2>The Full Screen Map Editor</h2>

<p>This is part of a series of pages describing the <a
href="MapEdit1.htm">Edit Maps Dialog</a>. This page describes the
Full Screen Map Editor.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/EmptyMap.GIF" width="640"
height="480"></p>

<p>The full screen map editor has a very simplified user
interface (because user interface implementation is not so easy
when every detail must be handled manually). The map is presented
according to the map display parameters set for the map. Moving
the mouse pointer to the edges of the screen will scroll the map.
As the mouse moves, the currently selected tile or TileMatch
draws itself on the current layer as it would if you clicked the
mouse to change that layer. The coordinates of this tile are
indicated at the top left corner of the screen. You can only edit
one layer at a time. To switch to editing another layer you must
exit the full screen editor, select a new layer and click Edit.</p>

<p>Some keys you can use while editing the map:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Arrow keys scroll the screen quickly (depressing an arrow
        key jumps a number of tiles in that direction)</li>
    <li>Control-S saves a screenshot of the current display</li>
    <li>Scroll lock engages the player. If a player sprite is
        defined, the map scrolling follows the player as it would
        while playing the game. You can continue to edit the map
        in this mode using the mouse. The inventory display will
        also be turned on.</li>
    <li>Escape exits the full screen map editor.</li>
    <li>Alt-Tab can be used to switch between the editor and the
        desktop.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><img src="Images/SelMatch.GIF" align="left"
hspace="6" width="397" height="46">Holding the right mouse button
will present the menu. This is where you can either select a new
tile or another command to perform within the full screen map
editor. If the tileset is taller than the screen, moving the
mouse to the bottom of the screen while holding the right mouse
button will scroll down to display more tiles. The following
describes each of the commands:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">Close: Close the full screen map editor.
        The current state of the map is retained in memory,
        except for the sprites which are always created from the
        sprite definitions when the map starts.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Copy: When this tool is selected, you may
        drag a rectangle around any area of tiles. This rectangle
        of tiles then becomes the current &quot;brush&quot; until
        another tool is selected. This does not put anything in
        the clipboard; it simply starts the process of selecting
        a range of tiles as a &quot;brush&quot;. Whenever you
        click after having selected the rectangle of tiles, that
        same rectangle of tiles will be &quot;pasted&quot; onto
        the map under the mouse pointer.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">Tilematch: This menu lists all the
        Tilematch objects defined for the tileset referenced by
        the current layer. Each Tilematch object has an
        associated eraser which can be used to (as cleanly as
        possible) erase tiles within areas composed of the tiles
        in the Tilematch. The eraser cannot always erase tiles
        cleanly, though. Tiles can only match if they are within
        a 2x2 block of similar tiles. Selecting a Tilematch
        automatically draws coherent objects composed of the
        tiles in the Tilematch when dragging the mouse or
        generating a maze.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Maze: This menu has two selections,
        Normal and Large Scale. Selecting one of these makes the
        maze generator &quot;tool&quot; current. After selecting
        one, drag a large rectangle over the map and that
        rectangle will be filled with a maze. A large scale maze
        has larger, longer passageways than a normal maze. This
        tool is best when used with a Tilematch.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="Images/PathMenu.GIF" width="397" height="67"></p>

<ul>
    <li>Paths: <strong>New path</strong> will prompt for a new
        path name; this name must be unique in the space of paths
        in the whole map (press Enter when entry is complete).
        Then you will see the path point cursor under the mouse
        pointer. Click out new points on the path and terminate
        the path with the right mouse button. The right mouse
        button does not add the point under the mouse. It
        terminates the path at the last point clicked. Many types
        of sprites will only require a one-point path. To do
        this, just click once on the point and then right-click.
        Each point in the path corresponds to the destination for
        the top left corner of a tile. If your path is designed
        for the center of the tile you can offset it with the
        &quot;Offset Path&quot; button in the <a
        href="Sprites1.htm">Sprites and Paths Dialog</a>. The
        &quot;<strong>Show All</strong>&quot; item toggles
        between &quot;Show All&quot; and &quot;Hide All&quot;.
        This makes all paths on all layers in the current map
        visible or invisible. (Drawing paths can get slow if
        there are too many.) <strong>Reset Sprites</strong> will
        terminate all sprite instances and recreate sprite
        instances based on the sprite definitions. <strong>Toggle
        Grid</strong> will snap the path cursor to the top left
        corner of map tiles. If your sprites are the same size as
        map tiles this can be useful in creating a path point
        that will start a sprite right up against a wall, floor
        or ceiling.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Add Special: Prompts for a special function name; this
        name must be unique in the space of special functions in
        the whole map (press Enter when entry is complete). Then
        the special function block will follow the mouse pointer
        around until you drag out a rectangle for the special
        function. All other existing special functions on the
        current layer are displayed in this mode. Special
        functions are always aligned on tile boundaries for the
        current layer (they are stored in tile coordinates rather
        than pixel coordinates). You have one chance to drag out
        the rectangle for any special function. If you ever need
        to do further maintenance on an existing special
        function, you must use the <a href="MapEdit5.htm">Special
        Functions</a> tab on the <a href="MapEdit1.htm">Edit Maps
        Dialog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>That wraps up about everything there is to know about the full
screen map editor.</p>
