<h2>Tile Categories</h2>

<p>This dialog allows you to categorize tiles for the purposes of
defining &quot;Solidity Definitions&quot; and for use with player
map interactions. The lower half of the dialog is dedicated to
defining Solidity Definitions.</p>

<p>Each tile category applies to a specific tileset. While the
categories are saved with the project (in the GDP file), they are
effectively indexed by tileset. This means you can have a
category named &quot;Solid&quot; for Tileset1 and another
category named &quot;Solid&quot; for Tileset2. A category simply
consists of a number of tile indexes. Internally the category is
a sequence of 256 bits (32 bytes) which can be used to very
quickly determine whether a tile is a member of the category.
Each bit represents &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; for whether
one of the possible 256 tiles in the tileset is a member of the
category.</p>

<p>The process of defining a category generally consists of these
steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select a tileset from the &quot;Tileset&quot; box</li>
    <li>Enter a name for the category you wish to create (or
        select the name of a category you wish to edit) from
        &quot;Current Category&quot;</li>
    <li>Drag tiles from the lower box (&quot;Tiles available in
        tileset&quot;) to the upper box (&quot;Tiles in this
        category&quot;) to add tiles to the category.</li>
    <li>If you want to remove tiles from the category, drag them
        from the upper box to the lower box.</li>
</ul>

<p>By dragging a tile into the upper box, the category named in
&quot;Current Category&quot; is automatically created if it
doesn't already exist. Changes to a category take effect
immediately and do not need to be explicitly updated. Deleting a
category simply involves selecting it from the &quot;Current
Category&quot; list and clicking the &quot;Delete Category&quot;
button. Only one category will be deleted. Categories with the
same name for different tilesets will not be affected.</p>

<h3>Solidity Definitions</h3>

<p>A Solidity Definition can be used in the &quot;Sprites and
Paths&quot; dialog to define how particular types of sprites see
the map (which tiles they see as solid etc).</p>

<p>To create a &quot;Solidity Definition&quot; you must have at
least one group of tiles that represent blocks that are solid (or
partially solid). Since Solidity Definitions are also specific to
a tileset, you must first select a tileset from the tileset list
at the top left of the dialog. Type the name of the Solidity
Definition you want to create into the &quot;Solidity Definition
Name&quot; field. This name, like a category name, is specific to
a tileset. Alternatively, select an existing solidity definition
if you want to edit one. Then, in the &quot;Solid tile
category&quot; list, select the category of tiles that represents
solid blocks in the current tileset (or &quot;&lt;none&gt;&quot;
of you don't have any completely solid tiles). Tiles in this
category are interpreted as completely solid. If you have tiles
that represent the following shapes, select that category in the
corresponding box indicated below (black area = non-solid):</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="Images/Uphill.GIF" width="32" height="32"></td>
        <td>Uphill tile category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="Images/Downhill.GIF" width="32" height="32"></td>
        <td>Downhill tile category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="Images/UpCeil.GIF" width="32" height="32"></td>
        <td>Ceiling up tile category</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="Images/DownCeil.GIF" width="32" height="32"></td>
        <td>Ceiling down tile category</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>All uncategorized tiles are assumed to be empty (non-solid).</p>

<p>If your tiles are not square, these are the rules used for
determining which part of the tile is solid:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The slope of all separations between solid and non-solid
        are 0, infinity, -1 or 1 (all diagonal lines are at nice
        45 degree angles)</li>
    <li>The uphill slope of an uphill tile always starts at the
        bottom left; anything above that is empty and anything to
        the right of that is solid.</li>
    <li>The downhill slope of a downhill tile always starts at
        the top left; anything below that is solid and anything
        to the right of that is empty.</li>
    <li>The uphill slope of an upward ceiling tile always starts
        at the bottom left; anything above that is solid and
        anything to the right of that is empty.</li>
    <li>The downhill slope of a downward ceiling tile always
        starts at the top left; anything below that is empty and
        anything to the right of that is solid.</li>
</ul>

<p>To delete a Solidity Definition, select the tileset you wish
to delete it from at the top left, select the name from
&quot;Solidity Definition Name&quot; and then click
&quot;Delete&quot;. This does not delete the categories involved
in the solidity definition, just the grouping of these categories
as a Solidity Definition (just as deleting a category does not
delete the tiles themselves).</p>

<p>All tile categories and solidity definitions are saved in the
GDP project file.</p>
